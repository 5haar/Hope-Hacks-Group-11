<h3> How to View/Visit Learnify </h3>

Our application is fully deployed on an EC2 instance. You can visit it <a href="http://18.212.64.60:4000" target="_blank">here!</a>


We utilized a wide variety of different technologies such as MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, Amazon EC2, EJS, and CSS (Front-End). <h6> If you would like to download our files and view/run the applicaton locally, we advise you to follow the steps outlined below: </h6>

  ➳ Clone, fork or download this repository to your computer.
  
  ➳ Open the Hope-Hacks-Group-11 folder in Visual Studio Code. 
  
  ➳ If you have NodeJS installed already, you can type the command: "npm install". This will download the Node modules and create an environment for you         to be able to run the app.
  
  ➳ Once you have installed the Node Modules, you can run the command "npm start" and it should specify if your localhost is listening on Port 4000. If           that does not work, try running the command "node app.js".
  
  ➳ Since we have utilized both a MySQL database and a MongoDB, you will only be able to use the website services that use the MongoDB because you would         have to host a SQL database to properly utilize those functions.
  
  ➳ Navigate over to your browser of choice (preferrably Google Chrome) and type "localhost:4000" as the URL. 
  
  ➳ Have fun!
